# Encourage-Bot-JS
A Discord Bot built using JavaScript/Node.js

This Bot was created using Node.js and JavaScript using the online IDE Repl.it as a tool to further my knowledge of Node.js and to have fun with Discord Bots. The server is run through Repl.it and kept online with a monitor provided by UptimeRobot.

Encourage Bot will scan through messages in the chat and flag negative words. For example: sad, angry, depressed and unhappy. When encountering one of these messages, Encourage Bot will reply to the user from a set of encouraging messages. This list of encouraging messages can be added to and deleted by the users in the chat. 

Methods:
- $list
- $inspire
- $new "message"
- $del "index"
